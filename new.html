  # new design planning

### Iteration outline

* quick intro  
  
> baltimore nodeschool is just getting off the ground. our first event is scheduled for sunday, may 4th at the digital harbor foundation in federal hill (complete with its very own PARKING LOT!). if you want to learn about node.js, or if you can come help others, [sign up to let us know you'll be there](http://ti.to/baltimorenodeschool/nodeschool)! if you need more info, keep reading...

* what is node, what is nodeschool

> node: javascript on the server. you can write the same javascript that powers jquery to edit and create and delete files, to make http servers, or do anything else a server-side scripting language like ruby, python, etc. can do

> nodeschool: a series of open-source command line workshops published on nodeschool.io meant to educate people on the basic concepts of node programming. you can do them on your own but it's better (and more funner) to do them as a part of a group at community events all over the world. and now we have our own event here in baltimore, and i think you should come.

* when is the event? sun may 4 from 1-5pm

* what do we need? 
    - Attendees: come and learn node, you need a laptop and a willingness to learn (def helps if you know javascript a little, but don't let that stop you!)
    - Mentors: come and stand around until someone makes a confused and frustrated face, then help them
    - Sponsors: we're set for our first event but if you'd like to sponsor a future nodeschool event, get in touch!
