      <p>Come learn how to node! We'll be working together on open-source workshop lessons from <a href="http://nodeschool.io">nodeschool.io</a> (see <a href="<%= site.upcoming.registerLink %>">the registration page</a> for which workshops we'll be doing each event). Come for the first time or come back and repeat a lesson over again--repetition is a good thing! Chances are good that you'll get further and understand more this time. :)</p>

    <h4><i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> Mentor!</h4>
    <div class="inset">
      <p>Come help others learn how to node! No need to be an expert, you just have to know a little more than someone else. <a href="<%= site.upcoming.registerLink %>">Register as a mentor for any/all of our events</a> and we'll be in touch with more details.</p>

      <p>Without sponsors, nodeschool would be in Jason's living room with very few chairs and no snacks. We'll be making sponsor tickets available on our registration page shortly, which will get you a place to put your sign/swag and a 2 minute pitch during our mid-event break. Stay tuned for more info...</p>

      <p>We have <a href="/baltimore/conduct-code.html">a code of conduct</a> that we're very serious about. Read it! If you don't agree, this is probably not the event for you.</p>

    <h2 style="margin-top: 1em;">A note about inclusivity</h2>
    <p>We're serious when we say we care about including everyone--so much that Jason gave a talk at CascadiaJS about the topic. You can watch the video here if you're interested in hearing more, and like we've already said, get in touch if you have suggestions.</p>

  <h1>Before You Come...</h1>
  <p>We want to make sure everyone who comes to NodeSchool gets the most out of it, so here are a few things to keep in mind:</p>
  <ul style="margin: 2em 0;">
    <li>If you've <em>never</em> done any code at all before, no HTML or CSS or Excel formulas or anything at all, the lessons we work on at NodeSchool are going to be pretty difficult. You should at least have a text editor and be able to open your command line tool. (If you're looking to get up to speed on the command line, read and work through <a href="https://zellwk.com/blog/fear-of-command-line/">this post</a>.)
    <li>If you generally know how to fake your way through the command line but you need a laptop, let us know and we can provide one.</li>
    <li>You should <a href="http://nodejs.org">install node</a> before you come. Make sure you know how to open your command line and run "node -v" to print the version of node you currently have. Also try "npm -v" to verify that npm was installed with node like it should have been.</li>
    <li>Install the course you plan to work on during the event. Find instructions at <a href="http://nodeschool.io/#workshoppers">nodeschool.io</a></li>
  </ul>

  <p class="message"><b>interested_person:</b> hey everyone, what's nodeschool?</p>
  <p class="answerbot"><b>nodeschool</b> is a series of open-source command line workshops published on nodeschool.io and created to teach people the <em>basic</em> concepts of node programming.</p>
  <p class="message"><b>new_beginner:</b> oh ok</p>
  <p class="message"><b>new_beginner:</b> except wait what's node?</p>
  <p class="answerbot"><b>node</b> is javascript on the server. you can write the same javascript that powers jquery to create and delete files, to make an http server, and other cool server-y things. coming to a nodeschool event is a great way to learn more about it, and we'll be happy to answer any questions you have!</p>
  <p class="message"><b>sherlock_holmes:</b> so baltimore nodeschool is just a baltimore event to learn node?</p>
  <p class="answerbot"><b>yep.</b> you can do the nodeschool workshops by yourself, but it’s better (and more funner) to do them as a group.</p>
  <p class="system">interested_person is now known as VERY_interested_person</p>
  <p class="message"><b>VERY_interested_person:</b> so what does a nodeschool event look like?</p>
  <p class="answerbot">we'll start with a brief intro to node and the workshopper tool, then we'll split into small groups and work together on the workshops. our awesome team of mentors will wander around and help if you get stuck.</p>
  <p class="answerbot">there'll be at least one break and we'll have plenty of <b>drinks and snacks</b> available throughout the event.</p>

  <p class="answerbot">for our first few events, <b>we thought it would be great if we all worked through learn you node together</b>. that's the only workshop our mentors will be prepared to help with, but you're certainly welcome to come and work on any lesson you want!</p>
  <p class="answerbot">at future events, our plan now is to <b>always</b> do learn you node but to add a second, more advanced workshop to do alongside it. we'd love to hear your suggestions!</p>
  <p class="system">secret_impostor has joined</p>
  <p class="message"><b>secret_impostor:</b> do you have to be a node expert to be a mentor?</p>
  <p class="answerbot"><b>absolutely not.</b> if you're familiar with the command line and know some javascript, try out the learn you node workshop on your own. if you make it through most of the exercises and you'd like to mentor, we'd love to have you! register as a mentor (you can always change your mind later)!</p>
