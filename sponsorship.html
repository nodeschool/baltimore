<h1 id="sponsorship">Sponsorship</h1>
<p>We can&#39;t put on nodeschool events here in Baltimore without some help from awesome sponsors. We want to make sponsorship as easy as possible, so if you&#39;d like to sponsor an upcoming event, just go to the registration page and buy a sponsor ticket. </p>
<p>A sponsor ticket currently includes (subject to change):</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Entry to the event for 2 representatives.</strong> Obviously, the event is free so you can send whoever you like, but we ask that you either send people who are participating in the event, or send a max of 1-2 reps who are only there to represent you as a sponsor. </p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>A place to put your sign and/or swag.</strong> Bring your logo sign, a box of giveaways, etc. Just please make sure anything you are giving away is respectful of our <a href="conduct-code.html">code of conduct</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>A 2-minute pitch during our mid-event break.</strong> This is a great time to raise awareness of your company, pitch open job positions, etc. to a room full of eager JavaScript learners. Again, please keep the pitch brief and respectful of our <a href="conduct-code.html">code of conduct</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have any questions, please contact Jason at jason.matthew.rhodes@gmail.com.</p>
